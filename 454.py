Create a function that takes an array of hurdle heights and a jumper's jump height, and determine whether or not the hurdler can clear all the hurdles.
A hurdler can clear a hurdle if their jump height is greater than or equal to the hurdle height.

hurdle_jump([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 5) ➞ True
hurdle_jump([5, 5, 3, 4, 5], 3) ➞ False
hurdle_jump([5, 4, 5, 6], 10) ➞ True
hurdle_jump([1, 2, 1], 1) ➞ False'''

list_=[5,4,5,6]
no_=10
if max(list_)<=no_:
    print(True)
