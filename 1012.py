''' Write a Python program to remove all elements from a given list present in another list.
Orginal lists:
list1: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
list2: [2, 4, 6, 8]
Remove all elements from 'list1' present in 'list2:
[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10]'''



list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
list2 = [2, 4, 6, 8]
lst_output=[ i for i in list1 if i not in list2]
print(lst_output)
