'''Equality Check
In this challenge, you must verify the equality of two different given parameters: a and b.
Both the value and the type of parameters need to be tested in order to have a matching equality. The possible types of the given parameters are:
Numbers
Strings
Booleans (False or True)
None
What have you learned so far that will permit you to do two different checks (value and type) with a single statement?
Implement a function that returns True if the parameters are equal, and False if they are different.'''

a=0
b=0
print(a==b and type(a) == type(b))
